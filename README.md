# Devsetup

This is a collection of configuration files and workflow enhancements that I've been curating over the years. 

Currently everything is separated out by program:

- [/bash](/bash) 
    - Bash profile settings. Contains aliases, a custom prompt set up, and more.
- [/iterm](/iterm) 
    - Contains all of the iTerm2 (v3.3.0) profiles that I've experimented with. Current favorite is "Blue-Yellow".
- [/vscode](/vscode) 
    - Contains my VS Code settings.json file. I use a modified version of the [_Popping and Locking_](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hedinne.popping-and-locking-vscode) theme currently.


## Fonts
I've experimented with a few fonts for development related tasks, but my current favorite is [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) (regular weight). I use this font in both VS code and iTerm.

Other fonts I've used:

- [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata)
- [Terminus](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/) (mostly only terminal use)
- [PT Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Mono)
